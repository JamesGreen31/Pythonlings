Welcome to Pythonlings!

This project is a series of small exercises designed to teach you Python step by step.

How it works:
-------------
1. Each exercise file starts with a special line at the very top:
   # REMOVE THIS TO MOVE ON
   When this line is present, the driver will stop at this exercise.
   To "unlock" it, delete that line and re-run the driver.

2. Inside each exercise, you’ll see function stubs with TODO comments.
   Your job is to replace "return None" or "pass" with correct code.

3. Tests for each exercise run automatically when you run the driver.
   If your code is correct, you'll see pass information.
   If not, you'll see fail information.

4. Continue this process module by module until you finish Pythonlings!

Try it now:
-----------
- Change the `continue_course()` function below to return 1 instead of 0.
- Save the file.
- Run the driver again.
- You’ll see the test pass, and the driver will explain how to unlock the first real exercise.
