# Capstone Project: Library Management System

## Goal
Implement a simple system that manages books and users.  
When all TODOs in `library.py` are implemented correctly,  
all tests in `test_library.py` should pass. 

## Steps
1. Open `library.py` and implement each TODO in order.
2. Run tests with:
pytest -v
3. When all tests pass, you are done
